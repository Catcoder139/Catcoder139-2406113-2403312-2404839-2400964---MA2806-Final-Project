OVERVIEW OF GAME

Right/left arrows to move. Space bar to jump. • Our game follows the main character, Mysha, throughout her day, with each level being a third of the day (morning, afternoon, and evening/night). On each level, the player has to collect Mysha’s daily necessities, for example, breakfast, within the time limit to progress to the next level. The first level will feature Mysha at home in the morning gathering supplies to get ready for the day, the second level will see her at university gathering supplies for study and the third level will return to her home where she relaxes and gets ready for bed. • In our game, we intend to explore the following themes: stress, responsibilities, and self-care. The theme of stress will be shown through the use of time constraints on each level. The theme of responsibility will be represented through the task of gaining all the necessities. Lastly, the theme of self-care will be represented through the use of meals and socializing as necessities to collect in the game.

INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS
Yasmin:

My duties included doing the coding for the player primarily and working with/providing support for Hannah during her coding of the tilemaps. I based the coding for the player class and collision functions on Hugh Hammond’s code but made changes to it (such as adding collectible interactions (with Hannah’s help)). I also commented on the whole code once it was complete, to demonstrate my understanding of Hugh’s original code. Regarding player movement, I added the code that flips the player sprite gif depending on the player's direction on the x-axis. Regarding the tilemaps, I helped Hannah code levels and level transitions by using different tilemaps/graphicmaps/tilerules arrays and the ‘level’ variable. I also played a role in debugging some parts of the code, such as editing the graphicmap/tilerules arrays to be proportional to the size of the canvas.

XinMeng (Hannah):

My job is to include the coding for the tilemap primarily and work providing support for Yasmin during her coding of the player. I have coded based on the coding for the tilemap collision detection algorithms that were implemented to accurately detect and resolve player interaction with the tilemap, ensuring smooth movement and gameplay. Based on understanding the code on Hugh Hammond’s I expanded the gameplay area, which allows to set three different level’s platforms making the game more interactive and increasing the difficulty. I help Yasmin to update tile graphics and rules for each level to offer different gameplay experiences. As well as enhanced the player movement mechanics for smoother controls and jumping behavior. I’ve managed to set three different levels with varying layouts and collectibles. When a player in each level touches the collectible the collectible disappears.

Sophie:

In our group project, I was responsible for coding the timer for the game. It would stop at 45/30/20 seconds (depending on the level) and trigger a fail screen if the player didn’t complete the level in time. At first, we had just one timer for the prototype however as we continued to work on the game, we decided to add different time limits for each level to make it more interesting for the player. Additionally, since the prototype, I wrote the code for the audio including background music and success and fail music effects to help enhance the overall player experience.

Marta:

As the illustrator, I created the game’s ambiance through my design of the backgrounds, assets, and characters. Some design choices had to be altered in keeping with the mechanics of the game: like the measurements of the tilemap; the platforms from which the character had to jump to/from; the colour of the background on the second level changed to a lighter hue as it hid the assets from view. In addition to this, I also coded the start/fail/congratulations pages including all the text, colours, and images within them.

THEMES
⁠In our game, we intend to explore the following themes: stress, responsibilities and self-care. The theme of stress will be showed through the use of the time constraints on each level. The theme of responsibility will be represented through the task of gaining all the necessities. Lastly, the theme of self-care will be represented through the use of meals and socialising as necessities to collect in the game. 


ANYTHING YOU'D ADD?

We developed the game narratives, characters, and themes as a group in workshop sessions. If we had an opportunity to expand the game, we would make the current levels we have sublevels and make each regular level a new day, perhaps having 7 levels (one week) and 3 sub-levels on each level. We may also enhance player collision detection with collectible items ('boxes') for better gameplay feedback and optimize the background music and sound effect handling for improved performance. As well as Adjusted background images ('bg','bg2','bg3') for better visual appeal and theme consistency.
